## A note on formatting

I've been programming computers since 1968.  In that time I have developed
a coding style that I am comfortable with.  I have nothing against others
choosing a different style, just don't push it on me.

If you with to use this code in your own project, the license allows you to
reformat it, and you may do so with my blessing.  I have no desire to force
my style on you; however, if you wish to contribute to this project, please
respect the style that I have chosen:

- Allman style braces.
- Single space inside parentheses for function definition and calls.
- Block indents use two spaces.
- When breaking long lines at a binary operator, the operator goes on
  the start of the second line.
- Align parts of similar statements vertically.
- Function parameters (except for self) start with:
  - in_  -- data passed into a function
  - out_ -- data passed out from a function
  - io_  -- data passed into a function and modifications passed out
